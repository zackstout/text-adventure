       * Maybe we still do have different tiers of tokens... So that with easy tokens you can only get first tier messages.
       * There should be some fun incentive for doing it the hard way, right?
       * The higher tier ones could be like paragraphs, specific memories, etc.
       *
       * Oooh maybe we should do the flashing ">_" underscore
