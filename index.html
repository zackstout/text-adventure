       * [ ] TODO: Some nice animation on buttons when they appear and disappear.

       *
       *
       * Maybe we still do have different tiers of tokens... So that with easy tokens you can only get first tier messages.
       * There should be some fun incentive for doing it the hard way, right?
       * The higher tier ones could be like paragraphs, specific memories, etc.
